# My-Very-Own-Malloc
Custom Malloc to do dynamic memory allocation


A personal project where I built a function similar to C's malloc, realloc, calloc and free. 


# Reason?

I wanted to learn how C does all the dynamic memory allocation and wanted to make my own to get a better grasp on C's memory allocation magic.
