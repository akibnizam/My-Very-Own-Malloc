# My-Very-Own-Malloc
Custom Malloc to do dynamic memory allocation


A project where I built a function similar to C's malloc, realloc, calloc and free. 


# Reason for this project?

This project was a way for me to learn how C does all the dynamic memory allocation and to make my own version of C's memory allocation magic.
